    headline: 'What is a social spot?'
    text: |-
      A Social Spot is a place where people meet, talk, laugh, and do things together - without needing an invite. It could be a community garden, an open mic, a culture house, or a weekly running club.
      Think of it as your shortcut to shared moments and new friendships.
